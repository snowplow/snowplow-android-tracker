/**
 * Configuration for a `MediaTracking` instance.
 *
 * @param id Unique identifier for the media tracking instance. The same ID is used for media player session if enabled.
 * @param player Properties for the media player context entity attached to media events.
 * @param pings Whether to track media ping events. Defaults to true.
 * @param pingInterval Interval in seconds in which the media ping events are tracked. Defaults to 30 seconds unless `pings` are disabled.
 * @param maxPausedPings Maximum number of consecutive ping events to send when playback is paused. Defaults to 1 unless `pings` are disabled.
