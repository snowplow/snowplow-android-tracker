# Android Analytics for Snowplow

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls] [![Release][release-image]][releases] [![License][license-image]][license]

## Overview

Add analytics to your Java software with the **[Snowplow][snowplow]** event tracker for **[Android][android]**. See also: **[Snowplow Java Tracker][snowplow-java-tracker]**.

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Android applications, games or frameworks.

## Quickstart

### Building

Assuming git is installed, clone the project.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-android-tracker.git
```

Then open the project in Android Studio and finish the setup.

### Testing

1. Tests require a device, whether emulator-based or a real one.

2. We need to run [Snowplow Micro][micro] before running trackers' tests. Micro will provide an endpoint that our tests will interact with.

3. Assuming Micro is running on `localhost:9090`, we need to make this endpoint publicly available. An option could be using an ssh-based service, `serveo`. Feel free to use any other tool serving the same purpose, like `ngrok`. The following is an example for `serveo`.

```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:9090 serveo.net
```
which should print something similar to
```
Forwarding HTTP traffic from https://micro.serveo.net
```

4. Copy the url without the scheme, `micro.serveo.net` in the example above, and insert a line to `local.properties` file as following:
```
microSubdomain=micro.serveo.net
```

5. Use Android Studio's capabilities to run tests or use `gradlew` CLI tool. e.g. At the root of the repository, run
```
./gradlew connectedCheck
```
